# 🚀 ARGUS PLATFORM - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
*Argus: Multi-Source Public Health Intelligence & Early-Warning System*

A sophisticated epidemiological surveillance platform that integrates multiple data sources for real-time outbreak detection and risk assessment.

## 🏗 Architecture

### Four-Pillar System:

1. *Clinical Data Ingestion* 🧬
   - Synthetic syndromic surveillance data generation
   - Epidemiological metrics calculation
   - Statistical anomaly detection using z-scores

2. *Twitter Surveillance* 🐦  
   - Social media symptom monitoring
   - Digital disease surveillance
   - Anomaly detection in tweet volumes

3. *Environmental Data Integration* 🌡
   - Weather and environmental factor simulation
   - Air quality monitoring
   - Environmental risk scoring

4. *Data Fusion Engine* 🔗
   - Multi-source data integration
   - Composite risk scoring
   - Unified surveillance dashboard

## 📊 Key Features

- *Real-time Anomaly Detection*: Statistical methods to identify outbreaks
- *Multi-Source Integration*: Clinical + Social + Environmental data
- *Risk Assessment*: Composite risk scoring with alert levels
- *Scalable Architecture*: Modular design for easy expansion
- *Production-Ready*: Error handling and data validation

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- *Python 3.14* with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- *Statistical Analysis*: z-score anomaly detection, moving averages
- *Data Engineering*: Multi-source data fusion and normalization
- *Public Health Analytics*: Incidence rates, epidemiological metrics

## 📈 Output Metrics

- Clinical cases with seasonal patterns and outbreak signals
- Social media symptom mentions with geospatial analysis  
- Environmental risk factors affecting disease spread
- Composite risk scores (Low/Medium/High) for actionable alerts

## 🎖 Employer Value

This project demonstrates:
- *Advanced Data Science*: Multi-modal data integration and analysis
